# Welcome to the Colorado Bear Hunting Draw Analysis 


## The Goal of this presentation: 
1. Provide a better understanding of how many people are submitting applications each year
2. Attempt to identify how many points it takes to be successful in a given unit 
3. Identify how many bear hunting tags are typically avaiable after the draw each year

## The target audience: 
1. Colorado State Wildlife Department
2. Hunters interested in pursuing bear in Colorado (Residents/Non Residents)

### This data provides the Colorado Department of Wildlife:
- A better understanding of where most bear hunters desire to hunt
- An idea of where bear management focus needs to be
- Which units they need to spend time on in order to attract hunters to assist with bear management
&nbsp;
### The analysis also provides hunters: 
- Where to spend there points (RES/NR)
- How many points they need for a unit they desire (RES/NR)
- Which units to not spend their points 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## The data

All data used in this project is publically available from the Colorado Department of Wildlife website.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
1. Unit BE041O1R 
   - Overall most left over tags 
   - No left over tags in 2012
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
2. Unit BE035O1R
   - Second highest unit with left over tags
   - No left overs tags in 2014
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
3. Unit BE004O1R
   - Most consistent from 2012 - 2019 (only unit with left overs every year)
   &nbsp;
   &nbsp;
## The most popular units

&nbsp;
### Criteria: 
The units were selected based on how many applications were submitted for a specific unit. 

1. Total of 7 units that had high applicants since 2015
   - BE061O1R
   - BE041O1R
   - BE075O1R
   - BE012O1R
   - BE004O1R
   - BEE71O1R
   - BE062O1R
&nbsp;
Note: Everyone drawing for BE004O1R should be selected.
&nbsp;
2. Three units with high applicants for a single year - 
   - Were the units not avaialbe in other years? 
   - What made those units highly sought after one year but not the others? 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Wasted preference points

&nbsp;
### These units had left over tags, but hunters used points during the draw (lets hope its an error)
1. One point equals one year
2. Highest points wasted : 
   - 17 points 2018
   - 16 points 2018, 2019
   - 15 points 2017, 2016, 2015
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## 2019 Pre Draw
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
1. This identifies how how many preference points were used for a given unit during the draw
2. Allows a hunter to decide where his best chances are with the given points
3. Compare and contrast how many points are used for a unit
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
1. Identify how many points it took to be successful in a given unit
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Machine Learning Tests
&nbsp;
### Two machine learning algorthims were used for this dataset. 
1. Test one: 

&nbsp;
2. Test two: 
&nbsp;
- Neither algorithm provided the accuracy desired. 
   - Restructure dataset?
   - Different algorithm?
&nbsp;
- 2020 Bear draw slighly changed 
- 2020 data is not provided to test the algorithm (variables) 
   - If accuracy was achieved, average of the past 2 years would be used as variables. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Things to update
1. Restructure data for Machine Learning algorithms?
2. Create a database (SQL) to store data as it grows with other species
3. Coordinate with CDOW - possible access to data not in a PDF format
