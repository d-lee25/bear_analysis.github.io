# Welcome to the Colorado Bear Hunting Draw Analysis 


## The Goal of this presentation: 
1. Provide a better understanding of how many people are submitting applications each year
2. Attempt to identify how many points it takes to be successful in a given unit 
3. Identify how many bear hunting tags are typically avaiable after the draw each year


## The target audience: 
1. Colorado State Wildlife Department
2. Hunters interested in pursuing bear in Colorado (Residents/Non Residents)

### This data provides the Colorado Department of Wildlife:
- A better understanding of where most bear hunters desire to hunt
- An idea of where bear management focus needs to be
- Which units they need to spend time on in order to attract hunters to assist with bear management
&nbsp;

### The analysis also provides hunters: 
- Where to spend there points (RES/NR)
- How many points they need for a unit they desire (RES/NR)
- Which units to not spend their points 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


## The data
All data used in this project is publically available: 
1. Colorado Department of Wildlife website
2. Huntscore.com (Assist with analysis)

1. Unit BE041O1R 
   - Overall most left over tags 
   - No left over tags in 2012
&nbsp;

2. Unit BE035O1R
   - Second highest unit with left over tags
   - No left overs tags in 2014
   &nbsp;

3. Unit BE004O1R

## The most popular units

&nbsp;

### Criteria: 
The units were selected based on how many applications were submitted for a specific unit. 

1. Total of 7 units that had high applicants since 2015
   - BE061O1R
   - BE041O1R
   - BE075O1R
   - BE012O1R
   - BE004O1R
   - BEE71O1R
   - BE062O1R

2. Unit BE061O1R consistently remained popular
   - Hunt Score 82/100 (What makes this unit popular)
      - 76% of the unit is public land  
      - Scored 100 for trophy potential
      - Scored 72 for opportunity

3. Everyone drawing for BE004O1R should be selected
   - Hunt Score 93/100 (What makes this unit popular)
      - 63% of the unit is public
      - Easy access
      - Opportunity

4. Three units with high applicants for a single year 
   - Were the units not avaialbe in other years? 
   - What made those units highly sought after one year but not the others? 


## Wasted preference points

### These units had left over tags, but hunters used points during the draw (lets hope its an error)
1. One point equals one year
2. Highest points wasted : 
   - 17 points 2018
   - 16 points 2018, 2019
   - 15 points 2017, 2016, 2015


## 2019 Pre Draw
<iframe width="1200" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" src="//plot.ly/~alee0187/13.embed"></iframe>

1. This identifies how how many preference points were used for a given unit during the draw
2. Allows a hunter to decide where his best chances are with the given points


## 2019 Preference Points table 

<iframe width="1200" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" src="//plot.ly/~alee0187/15.embed"></iframe>

1. Identify how many points it took to be successful in a given unit


## Machine Learning Tests
### Two machine learning algorthims were used for this dataset. 
1. Test one: 

2. Test two: 
- Neither algorithm provided the accuracy desired. 
   - Restructure dataset?
   - Different algorithm?
- 2020 Bear draw slighly changed 
- 2020 data is not provided to test the algorithm (variables) 
   - If accuracy was achieved, average of the past 2 years would be used as variables. 


## Things to update
1. Restructure data for Machine Learning algorithms?
2. Create a database (SQL) to store data as it grows with other species
3. Coordinate with CDOW - possible access to data not in a PDF format
