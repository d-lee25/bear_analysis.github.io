# Welcome to the Colorado Bear Hunting Draw Analysis 


## The Goal of this presentation: 
1. Provide a better understanding of how many people are submitting applications each year
2. Attempt to identify how many points it takes to be successful in a given unit 
3. Identify how many bear hunting tags are typically avaiable after the draw each year

## The target audience: 
1. Colorado State Wildlife Department
### This data provides the Colorado Department of Wildlife:
- A better understanding of where most bear hunters want to hunt. 
- An idea of where bear management focus needs to be
- Which units they need to spend time on in order to attract hunters to assist with bear management
&nbsp;
2. Hunters interested in pursuing bear in Colorado (Residents/Non Residents)
### The analysis also provides hunters: 
- Where to spend there points (RES/NR)
- How many points they need for a unit they desire (RES/NR)
- Which units to not spend their points 

&nbsp;
